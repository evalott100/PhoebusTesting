# Phoebus Testing

A repo to demonstrate the capabilities of [CSS phoebus](https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/phoebus) and [PVI](https://github.com/epics-containers/pvi).

To run the ioc install and source the python venv and then run

```
    run-ioc
```

This will regenerate pvi files in `bobfiles/pvi`.
